# Big Brain Rush

## Get started

Install the Unity Hub and install the required version of unity for the project.
You can use any code editor.

## Generate doxygen doc

To generate the documentation with doxygen, at the root of the project, run :

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

## Build

This version of the program does not build because we use editor specific code.
The only way to play the game is to launch the project in Unity.
This is only because of the save and load file dialog.
The first scene of the game is the Main menu one.
